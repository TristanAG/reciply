I just built this website with the [Next.js](http://nextjs.org) starter tutorial. It really is the most perfect basic starter blog template you could possibly imagine, and I totally love it right now. It seems perfect for a personal site, in addition to the React / Firebase projects im working on, which lead me to Next in the first place.

I'll build it out and add more and more personalization as I go, but for my purposes now, this works for me to have a fresh start with a website. Along those lines, I have no idea what the purpose of a website is anymore. In my industry, it used to seem like a necessity. I guess when I didn't have experience it was more social proof to your claims of skill. However, with social media, apps, linkedin, there's really no direct _need_ to have your own custom space when there are plenty of channels provided to you.

Yet I still find myself wanting to have a website. And I really just want to use it to document about development and ... and something that I can't quite put my finger on. Writing about my interests in, perhaps you could say alternative psychology? Philosophy? I'm very interested in the likes of Ram Dass, Robert Anton Wilson, Socrates, Mitch Horowitz, New Thought. I have a lot of things that I would enjoy writing about on these topics.

What has brought me here though is my desire to document writing about what i'm up to in development and side projects. I became interested in Next as an app idea i've had for a little while began to solidify in my mind. It's a recipe sharing / meal planning app that i've been thinking about for me and my wife. I'll talk more about it later, but the point is that I realized I wanted to build it on Next.

As I dove into Next I realized that I could build a super minimal statically generated site for myself that would be really easy to manage and solve the issues I would run into if I just used React. Im grateful that Next has created this technology, it feels so perfect to solve all these SSG / SSR issues that come with SPAs / PWAs üôè
