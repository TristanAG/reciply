Now that i undersand the basics of next and deployment, I know that I can make my net steps on my app. Understanding how next works just took a bit of time, but I feel like I get it now, and I have some confidence in how to get my questions answered and the basic ideas at this point.

So now im ready for the next part, and that is building the starter for my recipe app. What does that mean? I replicate what i've done so far for the basic starter blog site. I then put it in the context of implementing Firebase, changing posts to 'recipes', changing from internal storage to cloud firestore, then implementing firebase auth (user / password) login / logout screen. And i suppose before that login step i would also implement Bulma!

Then hey that is a new milestone, steps closer to actually building the app. But that app, at that point, using bulma and whatnot and all these features. That is a solid Next + Firebase starter, and I can through Bulma on there too, because i mean c'mon, that's hella cool! And then I can make a nice repo on github. Next.js + Firebase + Bulma starter.

So yea, can I get that done in a week? That would be cool if so... lets see if I can break it down more clearly.

-> i think lets just use this as an opportunity to to back through the udemy tutorial and reinforce my learning. I can just go through the tutorial and make it work for myself... it's totally chill to do that, integrate and put together.
