**You Are Not Your Reality Tunnel**

I originally learned about Reality Tunnels from the countercultural writer and linguist Robert Anton Wilson. I believe that Wilson was the one who coined the term 'Reality Tunnels', but I am not certain about that. Needless to say, his book Prometheus Rising has left a major imprint on me, introducing the idea of reality tunnels.

To quickly attempt to define reality tunnels (as i understand them) really only metaphores work to explain them. Reality tunnels are linguistic constructs, or maps. As Wilson said himself repeatedly in Prometheus Rising "The map is not the territory"

The easiest way to illustrate the idea of reality tunnels is to look at two opposing groups, as the contrast in reality tunnels is obviously stark and noticeable. The republican side sees the world one way, and the democrat way sees the world in another.

The reality tunnel of republicans contains beliefs that are contradictory to democrats, just as the  democrats belief system contains contradictory beliefs to the republicans. It's pretty clear and easy to see all kinds of opposing beliefs with this example.

Another way to say this is that both groups have disagreements with each other. Something as simple as that can do the trick as well. When we understand and experience ourselves as a part of a group or tribe, we are consciously (and unconsciously) subscribing to the belief systems inherent in the group. Because we are humans, tribal / primate mentality is a has been a dominant hierarchical structure throughout our evolution.

As we follow belief systems, group mentality, group thought, and not to mention the recipricol intoxicating joy of being 'in' a group. You get psychological benefits from being in groups. It is deeply embedded tribal mentality that we should exist in a tribe where we are protected, because rejection from a tribe is detrimental. Obviously more detrimental when we didn't consciously reason with the world.

There's so much to say about this, but the point of bringng theses tribal examples up is that they are reality tunnels. Im telling you that my definition, my understanding of reality tunnels is that they are the result of imprinted and / or imposed belief systems on your conscious and subconscious mind. The are belief systems about yourself, about your world, about those around you, about who is good are bad, what is actually right or wrong.

So the issue isn't how you arrived in your reality tunnel. You can assign blame forever to how you got your belief systems, how they were programmed into you, how they were imprinted on you. You can analyze your trauma, you can act out, there are an infinite amount of things you can do to fight against your reality tunnel, as you are enslaved to belief systems imposed upon you without your consent or understanding what was happening. You can remain a victim of your reality tunnel forever, lashing out at those around you and pointing the finger, when in reality it is your script that is consistently calling the shots.

The point is, you need to **recode your reality tunnel**

I know that we've barely started describing it, but you ahve to understand that your reality tunnel, your belief systems, they are programs that execute. input goes in, out comes reactive properties, brought upon by your synaptic imprints in your brain.

Lion runs towards you -> Execute scared program!
Your algebra teacher gives you an F on your quiz -> Execute self doubt problem!

you get it. Different kinds of things happen in reality, and you then react to them. A quick example of recoding your reality tunnel is adopting something like stoicism. Operating a new philosophical mindset and sticking to it is like signing up to be in a cult in a way. Adopting a philosophical mindset is to try on a new reality tunnel.

Your full reality tunnel does nto change of course. your beliefs to not change over night, but operating new forms of belief systems, you can see that your reality tunnel is maleable. _when you're able to see the world in a new way or experience yourself in a new or novel way, you have the potential to expand your reality tunnel._

New possibilities
